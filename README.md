# Brady Earnhart
Singer-songwriter based in Charlottesville, VA

Over the past 20 years Brady has been quietly building a solid reputation as a songwriter’s songwriter. His moving, tightly written, often funny songs have been compared to those of Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and Iron and Wine.

His first album, After You, was named “One of the ten best contemporary folk CD’s of the 1990s” by Acoustic Guitar magazine’s Elizabeth Papapetrou. The three that followed—Manalapan, so few things, and Last Time I Promise, received similarly high praise for their “sophistication and sensitivity,” “humor,” “poignant revelations,” and “impeccable lyrics.” He is currently recording his fifth collection, Wild Figurines.

Brady’s award-winning tunes have been included in several “best of” compilations of Virginia musicians and covered by the likes of [Paul Curreri ](https://youtu.be/nbGjUJVW2BU), Drew Pompano, and Patrick Keese. He is also active as an arranger and producer ([Mary Gordon Hall](https://youtu.be/NS0jIXTchNA), [Michael McConkey](https://youtu.be/H3jO0QKxP4c), [Naked Puritan Philharmonic](https://youtu.be/KMQqd92aWyo) and wrote the polyrhythmic cello score for Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Forrest Gander’s video collaboration [ReWilding](https://youtu.be/t8almAlWzYQ).

Brady has been a finalist at the Mountain Stage New Song Festival and the Outmusic Awards and has performed at such venues as Starr Hill, Acoustic Charlottesville, Acoustic Muse, the Shenandoah Coffeehouse Series, and the Florida Folk Festival, as well as pubs and coffeehouses throughout the eastern U.S. Since 2017 he has been co-writing, performing, and recording with Georgia songwriter Luke Kibler.

Brady has taught American literature and Creative Writing at the university level, poetry writing to elementary school students, and English as a Second Language. Besides continuing to make music, he is currently working as an interpreter for Spanish-speaking refugees in Charlottesville, VA through the International Rescue Committee.
